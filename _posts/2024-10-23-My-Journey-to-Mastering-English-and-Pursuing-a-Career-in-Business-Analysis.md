## This is my first blog post

Back in university, I faced the daunting challenge of passing my English certification with a score of over five hundred points. After failing four times, I finally managed to scrape through with five hundred twenty-five points. It was a low score, and after graduating, I thought I was done with English. That was until I met my hardworking roommate. Her dedication reignited my interest in learning.

I started by watching French movies on Netflix. It took me two years to finish my first one. At first, I didn't understand the humor, but by the end, I realized how much I wanted to immerse myself in English. This led me to explore the field of business analysis, a career that would allow me to combine my love for English and technology.

In late twenty twenty-two, while still working in a bank, I felt unfulfilled. I began learning English seriously and set myself three daily tasks: learning new vocabulary, writing articles, and recording my readings. This routine paid off, and by November twenty twenty-three, I felt confident enough to apply for a tour guide position.

Before becoming a tour guide, I realized I needed to practice speaking with native speakers to truly improve my English. So, I took the initiative to make friends with foreigners. I invited them for coffee, and through these conversations, I learned a lot. They corrected my mistakes, shared experiences, and helped me build my confidence in speaking. This approach not only enhanced my language skills but also introduced me to new perspectives and cultures.

In March twenty twenty-four, I decided to take a gap month to pursue certifications in business analysis. I earned several certificates on Coursera, including the Certified Business Analyst Professional and IT Project Management. Although I continued working at the tour company to support myself, I was committed to improving my English and knowledge in business analysis.

Now, I want to share this journey with others who might be afraid to start learning English. If you’re scared or think it’s too late to study, remember that every small step counts. Making friends and practicing with them can make all the difference. Don't hesitate to reach out and start your journey. You’ll be surprised at how much you can learn and grow!
